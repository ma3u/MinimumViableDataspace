## Title: Building a Minimum Viable Dataspace for Health Data: From Mock to EHDS Compliance based on the Dataspace Protocol

LinkedIn Post with the link to the arcticle:
My journey in building a Minimum Viable Dataspace for Health Data with AI Spec Driven Devlopment  🚀

In this article, I share my experience in developing a Minimum Viable Dataspace (MVD) for health data, focusing on compliance with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulation and leveraging the Dataspace Protocol.

# Other Ideas for the Health demospace project:

## Dataspace Insider View panel in the frontend 

- to show the interaction between data provider and data consumer based on the dataspace protocol. Use a centralied logging system to capture all interactions.
