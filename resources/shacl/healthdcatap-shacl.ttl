#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines SHACL shapes for all classes included in the HealthDCAT-AP NON_PUBLIC data specification.
# It includes all constraints to be satisfied, except for class range constraints, which are defined separately.
# By importing DCAT-AP shapes via owl:imports, this file ensures clear distinction between reused and extended constraints, promoting reusability and easing future upgrades.
