Subject: HealthDCAT-AP Editor v4.0 - Validation Discrepancy Report (SHACL passes, Editor fails)

Dear HealthDCAT-AP Editor Team,

I am writing to report a validation discrepancy in the HealthDCAT-AP Editor v4.0 
(https://ehds.healthdataportal.eu/editor2/).

SUMMARY
-------
Our catalog passes Apache Jena SHACL validation with the official HealthDCAT-AP 
Release 5 shapes (sh:conforms true), but the Editor reports 7 mandatory fields 
as missing despite them being present in the TTL file.

VALIDATION COMPARISON
---------------------
| Method                  | Result                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| SHACL (Apache Jena)     | ✓ sh:conforms true        |
| HealthDCAT-AP Editor    | ✗ 11/18 mandatory fields  |
| Actual fields in TTL    | ✓ 18/18 all present       |

FIELDS REPORTED AS MISSING (but verified present)
-------------------------------------------------
- dpv:hasPurpose         → 59 occurrences in TTL
- healthdcatap:hdab      → 21 occurrences  
- dpv:hasLegalBasis      → 42 occurrences
- healthdcatap:healthCategory → 51 occurrences
- healthdcatap:hasCodeValues  → 57 occurrences
- dcat:distribution      → 84 occurrences
- dct:identifier         → 121 occurrences

SUSPECTED CAUSE
---------------
The Editor may not correctly parse nested blank node structures such as:

  healthdcatap:hdab [
    a foaf:Agent ;
    foaf:name "Rheinland Universitätsklinikum HDAB" ;
    dcat:contactPoint [
      a vcard:Kind, vcard:Organization ;
      vcard:hasEmail <mailto:hdab@rheinland-uklinikum.de>
    ]
  ] ;

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
------------------
1. Go to https://ehds.healthdataportal.eu/editor2/
2. Upload the attached health-catalog.ttl
3. Observe validation panel showing missing fields
4. Compare with SHACL validation:
   
   shacl validate --shapes healthdcatap-shacl.ttl --data health-catalog.ttl
   # Result: sh:conforms true

ATTACHMENTS
-----------
