# Grafana Dashboard Provisioning
# NOTE: Provisioned dashboards are read-only from JSON files.
# To persist manual changes:
# 1. Export dashboard JSON from Grafana UI (Share > Export > Save to file)
# 2. Save to observability/grafana/dashboards/ directory
# 3. Commit to git - dashboards will be automatically reloaded
#
# For quick prototyping, create dashboards in the "General" folder - 
# these are stored in the grafana_data volume and persist across restarts.
